# Instagram-Account-Creator
Creates random Instagram accounts with Selenium, C#.

# How To Use

Step 0 : Make sure you have dotnet installed.

Step 1 : If your google chrome version doesn't match with chrome driver inside the project, Install required chrome driver version.

Step 2 : You can update names.txt file with your desired name list.

Step 3 : Just Run It


# How Does It Works 
This project generates passwords and usernames randomly. Uses a temp mail to sign up to instagram.

If you sent to much request to Instagram, you have to change your IP address using VPN services.

The account created this way probably will get banned in an instant but it works so cool. (sometimes 50% works...)
